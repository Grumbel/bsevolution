BSEvolution - Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To compile BSEvolution you need the Sun's non-free Java compiler
version 1.2 or above, for example you can get that from
http://www.blackdown.org. BSEvolution hasn't been tested which other
compilers or other versions of Sun's compiler so it might for work
not, try yourself.

When you have the compiler installed, all you need is to type "make",
this will compile all the classes. To start BSEvolution on a Unix
system, just type "./bsevolution", to start it on non Unix systems you
have to start the class "Main", look at your Java Runtime docs for
details.
